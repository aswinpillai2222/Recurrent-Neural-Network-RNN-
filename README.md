Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Project

📌 Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sequence-based tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and time series forecasting. The implementation supports LSTM and GRU architectures and includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.

✨ Features
Implementation of RNN, LSTM, and GRU models
Support for text and time series data
Data preprocessing scripts for text tokenization and sequence padding
Training and evaluation on custom datasets
Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
Integration with TensorFlow/Keras & PyTorch

🛠 Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/aswinpillai2222/rnn-project.git
cd rnn-project
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage
1️⃣ Train the Model
python src/train.py --dataset data/train.csv --epochs 10 --batch_size 64

2️⃣ Evaluate the Model
python src/evaluate.py --dataset data/test.csv

3️⃣ Run Inference
python src/inference.py --input "Sample text input"

📊 Results
The model is evaluated using standard metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score (for classification) or MAE, MSE, RMSE (for regression/time series).
